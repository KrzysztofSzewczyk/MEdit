# MEdit

This project is my attempt to create useful and full-featured java editor.
Im thinking about it as editor focused on programming, but I might add something
like Eclipse workspaces. GUI library that will be used for development is Java
Swing. 

## Setup

Building this project is really simple, you just need JDK and IntelliJ IDEA. 
IntelliJ IDEA should build it automatically, if not you should press build menu item.
.JAR file should be made automatically

## Dependencies

There are no depedencies for actually building this project (JDK, IntelliJ IDEA and JRE
should be installed, but it's rather obvious). To make changes to the project, you are
recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA. Remember to suggest me changes that you made using
pull reques feature!
