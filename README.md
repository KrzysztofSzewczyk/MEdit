# MEdit

This project is my attempt to create useful and full-featured java editor.
Im thinking about it as editor focused on programming, but I might add something
like Eclipse workspaces. GUI library that will be used for development is Java
Swing. 

## Setup

Building this project is really simple, you just need JDK and Eclipse (I'm using
Oxygen.2 one). Just switch workspace to the place where you've cloned repository.
Eclipse should build it automatically, if not you should press build button.
You can make .jar file by doubleclicking jardesc file and following instructions
appearing on screen.

## Dependencies

There are no depedencies for actually building this project (JDK, Eclipse and JRE
should be installed, but it's rather obvious). To make changes to form, you are
recommended to use Eclipse WindowBuilder.
